      <h1>▸ VOID ENIGMA ▸ PRIVACY POLICY ▸</h1>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-6 text-right">
        Last updated: January 30, 2026
      </p>

      <h2>1. INTRODUCTION AND CONTACT</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how
        <strong>Grasshopper IT Solutions, LLC</strong> ("we," "us," or "our")
        manages information in relation to the
        <strong>Void Enigma</strong> mobile application (the "App"). We are
        committed to protecting your privacy by minimizing data collection and
        maintaining transparency about how the App operates.
      </p>

      <p>If you have any questions regarding this policy, please contact us:</p>
      <p><strong>Company:</strong> Grasshopper IT Solutions, LLC</p>
      <p><strong>Email:</strong> grasshopper.it.solutions@gmail.com</p>

      <h2>2. DATA COLLECTION AND ANONYMITY</h2>
      <p>
        The App is designed for anonymity and <strong>does not</strong> collect,
        store, or transmit any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about
        you.
      </p>

      <p>Specifically, the App:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Does <strong>not</strong> require user accounts, registration, names,
          email addresses, or phone numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Does <strong>not</strong> collect precise location data, contacts,
          photos, or messages from your device.
        </li>
        <li>
          Does <strong>not</strong> use third-party analytics or user tracking
          SDKs.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. USE OF THE PERPLEXITY AI API</h2>
      <p>
        The core function of the App is to generate riddles using the Perplexity
        AI API. This interaction involves transmitting data outside the App to
        Perplexity's servers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Data Transmitted:</strong> When you request a new riddle, the
        App sends a brief, non-personal text prompt to the Perplexity API (e.g.,
        "Generate a fun, short riddle"). This request
        <strong>does not</strong> include any information that identifies you or
        your device.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>API Key Security:</strong> The developer API key used to
        communicate with Perplexity is secured within the application's code and
        is never exposed to the end-user.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Data Handling by Perplexity:</strong> Your interaction with the
        Perplexity AI API is subject to Perplexity's privacy policies. We
        encourage you to review
        <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/privacy" target="_blank"
          >Perplexity's Privacy Policy</a
        >
        for details on their data practices.
      </p>

      <h2>4. ADVERTISING AND GOOGLE ADMOB</h2>
      <p>
        The App displays non-intrusive advertisements through
        <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to support ongoing development and
        operation. These ads are served by Google's advertising network and may
        include banner ads and interstitial ads.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What Google AdMob Collects:</strong> Google AdMob may collect
        limited information to serve relevant ads, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your general location (country, region) based on IP address for
          geo-targeted advertising.
        </li>
        <li>
          Device identifiers and ad-related user identifiers for frequency
          capping and ad measurement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Advertising preferences and browsing patterns for ad personalization.
        </li>
        <li>
          Interactions with ads shown in the App for performance analytics.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>No Personal Information:</strong> Google AdMob
        <strong>does not</strong> collect your name, email, phone number, or
        other personally identifiable information through the App. Ad targeting
        is based on anonymized device data and general demographics, not
        personal identity.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Data We Do NOT Receive:</strong> We do not have access to any of
        the data collected by Google AdMob. This information is used solely by
        Google for ad serving and measurement purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Opting Out:</strong> You can limit ad personalization through
        your device settings:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Android:</strong> Settings → Google → Manage your Google
          Account → Data & Privacy → Ad settings
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>iOS:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Apple Advertising →
          Personalized Ads (toggle off)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Additional Opt-out Options:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Ad Choices:</strong> Visit
          <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/" target="_blank"
            >optout.aboutads.info</a
          >
          to opt out of interest-based advertising from participating companies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Network Advertising Initiative:</strong> Visit
          <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank"
            >optout.networkadvertising.org</a
          >
          for additional opt-out options.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Data Handling by Google:</strong> Google's use of ad data is
        governed by
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank"
          >Google's Privacy Policy</a
        >
        and
        <a
          href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en"
          target="_blank"
          >Google AdMob's Privacy Policy</a
        >. We encourage you to review these policies for complete details on
        ad-related data practices.
      </p>

      <h2>5. DATA STORAGE AND RETENTION</h2>
      <p>All data storage related to your activity is minimal and temporary:</p>

      <p>
        <strong>In-App Memory:</strong> The App temporarily stores the current
        riddle and answer in your device's memory for display purposes. It also
        maintains an in-memory history of recently seen riddles to minimize
        repetition within a single session.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Data Deletion:</strong> This temporary session data is
        immediately cleared when you fully close the App or explicitly reset the
        history. No long-term persistent storage (like cookies, local storage,
        or databases) is used to track session history or store riddles between
        launches.
      </p>

      <h2>6. SECURITY MEASURES</h2>
      <p>
        We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to
        protect the limited data we process:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>API Communication:</strong> All communication with the
        Perplexity AI API is conducted over encrypted HTTPS connections to
        ensure data security in transit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>API Key Protection:</strong> The developer API key used to
        access the Perplexity AI service is securely embedded within the
        application code and is not accessible to end users.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Local Data Security:</strong> Any temporary data stored in your
        device's memory is cleared immediately upon app closure and is not
        written to persistent storage.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Third-Party Security:</strong> While we implement security
        measures for our part of the data processing, we rely on Google AdMob
        and Perplexity AI to maintain appropriate security measures for their
        respective data processing activities.
      </p>

      <h2>7. USER RIGHTS</h2>
      <p>
        Since we do not collect or store any personally identifiable information
        about you, your privacy rights are inherently protected. However, you
        have the following rights regarding your interaction with the App:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Right to Opt Out of Ads:</strong> You can opt out of
        personalized advertising through your device settings or the third-party
        opt-out mechanisms listed in Section 4.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Right to Data Deletion:</strong> All temporary session data is
        automatically deleted when you close the App. You can also manually
        clear the App's cache through your device settings if needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Right to Access Information:</strong> This Privacy Policy
        provides complete transparency about what data we do and do not collect,
        how we use it, and with whom we share it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> You can stop using the App
        at any time, which effectively withdraws any implied consent for data
        processing.
      </p>

      <h2>9. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>
      <p>
        The App is a riddle game intended for a general audience and is designed
        to generate content suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect
        any personal information from children under the age of 13. If a parent
        or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with personal
        information, they should contact us immediately at the email provided in
        Section 1.
      </p>

      <h2>10. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as we add new
        features or comply with new legal requirements. We will notify you of
        any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy here and updating the
        "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.
      </p>
